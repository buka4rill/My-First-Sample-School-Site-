# My-First-Sample-School-Site-
This was a sample website I created in 2018 after I had just finished learning Web designing at New Horizons, Ibadan during my compulsory National Service. I created it, hoping to host it for the school if all turned well. I wasn't able to finish it by the time I was done with service.
